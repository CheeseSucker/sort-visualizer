Sort visualizer
============================

Shows how several different sorting algorithms work in realtime.

The sorting algorithms are based on the book "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

Currently implemented sorting algorithms:
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Merge sort (top down, with cutoff for insertion sort)
  - Merge sort (bottom up)
  - Shellsort
  - Quicksort
  - Heapsort
 
I use some code from StdLib shipped with the book, so I must license the code under GPL.
